# Covid19-Analysis
This project is based on data analysis of COVID-19 of Top 15 Countries. 
Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant indentation. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects. 
Corona virus disease (COVID-19) was an infectious disease caused by corona virus and had caused massive disturbance in the daily lives of human beings from 2019-2023. Thus it is important to analyse the situation and gather information on how many people are affected, how many are recovered, etc.
So this project helps analyze the situation by using various functions like max (), min (), sum (), loc () and data visualization by matplotlib. Matplot library is used for plotting charts and graphs.
Pandas is used to create dataframes and series to analyse, and manipulate data. Thus, Python is the best programming language for this project on analysis.
